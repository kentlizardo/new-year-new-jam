J: "Oh! Mina!"
M: "Did you two get home safe?"
J: "Uh, yeah we came home safe!"
"I think he's a little sad right now..."
"After we went to the mall,\n he wanted to go on those little mini trains with me"
"We went on, and had a fun time!"
"...for about 20 seconds."
M: "Oh?"
J: "The trolley broke down\n probably from our weight I think..."
"And then when we went to the cafe..."
"The waiter tripped and spilled drinks on the both of us..."
M: "Oh dear..."
J: "Don't worry! He was fine!"
"They were iced drinks anyway!"
"He smelt great after that!"
M: "?"
J: "Oh... Nevermind that!"

"Oh well would you look at the time!"
