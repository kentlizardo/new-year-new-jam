E: "Mina!!! MY BFF"
"I heard from Ms. Ava that you agreed to help me. ðŸ˜­"
"You're doing me such a huge favor!"
"I owe you so much. ^^"
M: "Right... I totally remember telling her I'd help you."
"Remind me what the details of the client are again?"
E: "Okay so... It's my Pops!"
"He's been on edge at home ever since he's been forced to retire."
"Since y'know, he's got nothing to do and I'm sure staring at me and my new BF hang out at home"
"Please find him someone to get him out of the house! And maybe to make him not so cranky too :P"
M: "Alright."
"I think I got the basic gist."
E: "Tysm! You're one of the best Cupids I know!"
M: "Enough with the flattering ðŸ˜”. I already said I'd help."

W: "Hello?"
"Is this one of those robots in the phone? Or a real person?"
M: "Good afternoon, a representative is speaking to you currently. No robot here ðŸ˜‡."
W: "Sorry, I'm not really used to these things."
"My grandkid signed me up for this,"
"I told her it didn't really matter, y'know."
"I'm a little too old for these kinds of things now."
"But she [i]was[/i] really insistent."
"And she did say she knew someone who was an expert."
M: "I'll do what I can!"
"No one is too old to find a good partner,"
"Let's see what we've got!"
