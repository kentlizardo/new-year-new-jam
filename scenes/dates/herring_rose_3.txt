R: “I found my date!!!”
"I’ve been searching all day and night,”
"Turns out he was lying in the forest nearby!”
M: “That’s great!”
R: “Um… "
"Just one thing,” +sweat
“Why..."
"is he so small?\n And melty?”
M?: "Hmm..."
M: “Slimes are known to be weak under dark and dry conditions.”
“They actually use a form of photosynthesis\n with the algae in their fluids\n to generate their body mass.”
“It sounds like he hasn’t been able to keep his body intact... or from drying out.”
“Take him to the nearest healer A.S.A.P!”
R: "Oh!!!" +shaking
“By then it will be too late…”
"It's all my fault!"
“No!”
“Think, Rose, think!”
R: “Oh, I know what to do!”
“I just learned how to cast Daylight!”
“I’ll save you my prince!”
