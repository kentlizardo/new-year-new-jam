"I’ve been searching all day and night,”
"Turns out he was lying in the forest nearby!”
M: “That’s great!”
"...Not the forest part."
R: “Um… "
"Just one thing,” +sweat
“Why..."
"is he so small?\n And melty?”

M: "Hey Alex, you there?"
A: "Yes. What's up Mina?"
M: "How would a slime get, um."
""Small and melty""
A: "Hmm."
"I'm not quite sure. What happened to this slime?"
M: "He was found in a forest at night"
A: "Okay."
A: "So Slimes are known to be weak under dark and dry conditions."
“They use a form of photosynthesis with the microalgae in their fluids to generate their body mass.”
“It sounds like he hasn’t been able to keep his body intact... or from drying out.”
A: "They'd need to get medical attention immediately."
M: "Okay! Thank you Alex!"
A: "No problem."

R: "But that's really far away!"
"By then it will be too late…"
"...It's all my fault!"
"...My last partner said I act too much like a hero and not like a maiden..."
"Only if I hadn't been so careless,"
M: "It isn't your fault!"
"Being brave isn't a bad thing. You even did all that work to find him!"
"Let me go get help,"
R: "Mmm..."
"Think, Rose, think!"
"Oh! I have an idea!"
"I just learned how to cast Daylight in my knight training!"
"..."
R: "I only have a 33% success rate so far..." +sweat
M: "You should try it!"
R: "But what if I mess up the spell?"
M: "You won't."
R: "..."
R: "I'm not a real knight yet..."
R: "I didn't pass my written exams, and barely passed the combat tests..."
"...What if I can't save him?"
M: "Those are tests. Not the real world."
"The only thing that matters is if you save him, not a piece of paper!"
R: "..."
M: "No matter what your last partner said, what Herring needs right now is [i]a hero[/i]."
R: "...You're right!"
"There's no time like right now to become a hero!"
"I’ll save you my prince!" +shaking
"It's..."
"It's working!!!"
"He's reforming!"
"I..."
"I did it!"
M: "You did!!!"
"You really are a knight, Miss Rose!"
R: "..."
"I'm a real knight..."
"..."
"Oh... speaking of-"
M: "Emergency services should already be on their way! A healer should be heading towards you two right now."
"Just keep him safe!"
R: "Alright, okay..."
"Thank you Miss Mina,,,"
"For saving me and Herring."
