C: "Hello, is this Mina?"
M: "Who's asking?"
"Ah, I'm kidding of course,"
"It's always a pleasure talking to one of my clients."
"How are you doing, Clydie?"
C: "Right!"
"Things are going well with Wulf."
"He's such a dearie."
"Although,"
"He's quite the funny technology user."
"Miss Emma got him a copy of Terraformia to play with me."
M: "Oh!"
"Really?"
"Hehe."
"It's quite amusing to picture him playing a video game."
C: "It's certainly entertaining."
M: "Are you an avid enjoyer of games?"
C: "Ah, yes."
"There's not much else to do on the orchard."
"So I got quite good at them."
M: "I thought it was dangerous for Fey to be near certain metals in computers?"
C: "Ah! You're very learned."
"For my nameday, I asked my guardians to commission a specialist in runecraft to make a personal one."
M: "That's incredible!"
C: "Not as incredible as Wulf attempting to use a mouse and keyboard at the same time."
"Who knew such a mettled warrior could fail at such an activity."
M: "Haha"
C: "Oh, while we're on that topic."
"I actually wanted to ask you for some ideas on what to do."
"Despite how much he's trying to learn for me,"
"I want him to enjoy time with me as well."
"How about it?"

    C: "Oh, you're a fan of games too, Mina?"
    M: "Not exactly... I mean theres more games like online versions of board games."
    "Social and party games! Maybe you could introduce some of your orchard members and his family?"
    C: "Ah, we might be a long ways away from that at this point,"
    "But I'll keep those games in mind." *<post_a>
<a_2>/group
    C: "Oh we've already video called if that's what you're saying."
    "What do you mean by activities?"
    M: "You could, hmm, cook for example?"
    "Have a cook-off? Or maybe see who can impress eachother's family more?"
    C: "Ah, I'm not allowed to cook, or use fire in the orchard."
    "I'm... might be banned from the eating area."
    M: "Huh!"
    "You could always ask those runecraft specialists to craft a special oven."
    C: "Ah, I'm also banned from contacting them after I... requested more items with the orchard's budget."
    M: "Hmm. You could try reading some books to eachother."
<a_3>/group
    C: "Ah!"
    "Do you have any good recommendations?"
    M: "Actually,"
    "...maybe, Emma is better than me at this kind of thing ðŸ˜…."
    C: "Wow,"
    "I think this is the first time I've heard another Cupid being better at a topic than you!"
    M: "Hey!!!"
    C: "I'm merely teasing. I wouldn't forget you, even if me and Wulfie don't last as long as I'd want us to."
    "...I want us to last as long as possible."
    M: "I really hope you do too."
<post_a>C: "Thank you for the recommendations."
"I'll keep them in mind next time I call Wulfie."
"Speaking of-"
M: "Keep me updated on how it goes! :D"
